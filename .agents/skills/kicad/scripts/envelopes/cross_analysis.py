"""Cross-analysis output envelope (v1.4 SOT).

The runtime of ``cross_analysis.py`` emits a minimal top-level shape —
the analyzer is a second-pass consumer of schematic and PCB JSON, so
there are no structural maps of its own. Every cross-domain check
(CC-001, EG-001, DA-001, XV-001..003, NR-001, RP-002, TW-001, PS-002,
VS-002, DP-005) writes into the shared ``findings[]`` array.

Top-level runtime keys (current):
    analyzer_type, schema_version, elapsed_s, summary, findings,
    trust_summary

Stage/audience pipeline may add:
    audience_summary — always added by ``apply_output_filters`` when
                       findings[] is non-empty
    stage_filter     — added only when ``--stage`` is passed

Tightens:
    - analyzer_type + schema_version carry ``const`` discriminators.
    - summary is a typed dataclass mirroring runtime shape
      (total_findings + by_severity).
    - trust_summary reuses shared ``TrustSummary`` primitive.

Additional properties are permitted by JSON Schema default. The
cross-analysis envelope is intentionally small: unlike the schematic /
PCB / EMC analyzers, it produces no structural bags of its own.
